            Physical Items
        </h3>
        <p>
            Battery Testing System (BTS): The system contained within the rack or enclosure which allows for testing of
            batteries.
        </p>
        <p>
            IPC: An integrated PC into the BTS which runs the Interaction, and execution layers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Channel Module: A self-contained module that houses the power electronics which allow for energetic cycling
            of batteries.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            External I/O: Additional measurement devices that come from separate devices not originally contained in the
            BTS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Battery: The unit under test. A secondary battery that is connected to the BTS via a Main Channel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Main Channel: A set of positive and negative leads for voltage measurement and current delivery from the
            Battery Testing system that connects to exactly one Battery. Note if only “Channel” is written outside of
            any context, then it refers to a main channel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Auxiliary channel: A measurement apparatus for any additional parameters that a Main Channel does not
            capture. These channels may be located on channel modules or external I/O. For example, temperature, or
            pressure would be measured via Aux Channels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thermal Chamber: Environmental enclosure that allows for control of the ambient temperature that a battery
            operates in. For simplicity environmental chambers that control relative humidity, or atmospheric pressure
            will also be referred to as Thermal Chambers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Metric: a measured or calculated value received from a physical device. Example of, Voltage, Temperature, or
            Ah Discharge.

        </p>
        <p>
            Non Energetic Step: control methodology where there is no transfer of energy. These are often steps to wait
            for battery temperature to change, or section data for easier post processing.
